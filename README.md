Renewable energy is becoming a more and more important topic as our natural resources drain. Many social factors are influencing and influenced by the use of renewable energy, such as economy, education and environment. To explore this, a model is built with selected social factors that might influence the use of renewables: education expenditure, GDP, population density, surface area, electricity access and research expenditure for each country, and renewable is presented by the ratio of electricity generated by renewables to total electricity generation for the countries. Data from World Bank, Government of Canada and Wikipedia are analyzed with R in RStudio, and a statistically significant model was built. Our model shows that GDP and education level have a positive relationship, and population density, electricity access have a negative relationship with the electricity generation percentage by renewable energy. Change of this percentage over time for provinces in Canada is then looked at more closely and we see that there's a gap between Canada provinces with high generation percentage by renewable energy and provinces with low percentage. Future researches could be done on adding more factors to the model, then building and comparing Canada's model with model for the world to see if the same factors are influential.
